# Virus

Is your fantasy pathogen the greatest disease to hit this world? Create your pathogen in Virus and see just how far and widespread your pathogen can reach!

Virus uses Bluetooth Low Energy to seamlessly detects other players nearby and enables you to infect or heal them by simply connecting your virus to theirs. As you infect more people, your fantasy pathogen spreads. Along the way, you will also earn points to increase how long your pathogen infects others and the maximum amount of energy you have! You can then compare your rank with others by simply clicking on any of the pathogens on the screen.

Each infection or healing requires energy. And the more energy you use, the higher the success rate of that action. Donâ€™t worry if your energy reaches 0 though! As time passes, you will regenerate energy, allowing you to continue your quest to infect the entire world!
